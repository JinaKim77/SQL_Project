    SQL_Project
</h2>

<br>

In this project, I will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. 
<br>
I will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer questions about the database. 
<br>
As part of this project, I will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of my queries.

I will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. 
<br>
For this, I will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

The schema for the DVD Rental database is provided [Here](https://github.com/JinaKim77/SQL_Project/blob/main/DVD-RENTAL-ERD.PNG)
