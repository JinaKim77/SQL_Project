In this project, I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. 
<br>
I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answered questions about the database. 
<br>
As part of this project, I ran SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of my queries.

<br>

I queried the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. 
<br>
For this, I queried the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.
